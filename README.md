<h1>Read Me: BarCrawlz</h1>
<br/>
<h2>What BarCrawlz does</h2>

This full stack React-in-Rails App was created by Summer Cook, Filippo Venturini, and Ryan Sarll. It uses information from the Yelp Fusion API, and 3 data tables in rails includes Rails Devise for its users. It also uses Reactstrap for consistent styling.

The app uses the Yelp Fusion API's business search endpoints to look bars in a specific location. The app enables users to add bars to lists called "Crawls."

<br/>
<h2>Why This Project is Useful</h2>

We created this app as a way to more easily plan out a night on the town. We know how long it can take to sift through ratings, restaurants, and bars on Google Maps or Yelp to figure out which look the most fun for a night out.

<br/>
<h2>How Users Can Get Started with the Project</h2>

Sign up as a user- this app includes Rails Devise and enables users to sign up for an account. From there, start creating groups of bars at your leisure
